 * \brief cxPanel is a window that contains other windows.  When showModal()
 * \brief is called, focus will cycle through all the subwindows in the order
 * \brief they were added.<br>
      virtual long showModal(bool pShowSelf = true, bool pBringToTop = true,
                             bool pShowSubwindows = true);
 * These are the steps to add a window to a cxPanel:<br>
 * 1) Create it dynamically (i.e., with the 'new' operator)<br>
 * 2) Add it to the cxPanel with the append() method<br>
 * All windows added to a cxPanel must be created dynamically because
 * cxPanel's destructor will free the memory used by the windows it
 * contains.<br>
 * The windows added to a cxPanel via append() are managed in a
 * collection that is separate from the subwindow collection contained in
 * the base class (cxWindow).  This is because the subwindows cotnained by a
 * cxPanel are assumed to be created dynamically, but cxWindow does not
 * make this assumption with the subwindows.<br>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Since all of the windows contained in a cxPanel are also added to
 * the list of subwindows inherited from cxWindow, it is not necessary to
 * overload show() in this class.
 * <li>If all the subwindows in your panel are full-screen, you may want to
 *     consider calling setShowPanelWindow(false) so that the panel window
 *     is not drawn before the subwindows.  This will avoid redrawing the
 *     entire screen when subwindows are shown, which will noticeably speed
 *     up screen redraws on slow terminals.  In addition, if all the
 *     subwindows in a panel are full-screen, showModal() should be called
 *     with the first argument false to avoid redrawing the whole screen.
 * </ul>
